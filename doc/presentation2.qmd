## Introduction {.centered}
<small>Prostate cancer, a disease that significantly impacts the lives of men, requires a thoughtful exploration to refine diagnostic approaches and treatment regime. Understanding the complexities of this condition is crucial, emphasizing the importance of applying advanced data analysis techniques to patient data. Extracting meaningful insights from extensive data sets not only deepens our understanding of prostate cancer but also equips healthcare professionals with valuable information to personalize patient-by-patient Our goal is to delve into the connections, patterns, and predictive models associated with prostate cancer and patient outcomes, ultimately enhancing our ability to provide more personalized and effective care for individuals facing this issue.</small>

## Materials and Methods

<small>We rigorously revised columns for clarity and consistency, changing text into numerical values for better analysis, when preparing the data for study. Replacing or removing missing values resulted in a more complete dataset. Splitting columns to keep single-value cells was also important. These procedures were designed to optimize the data, paving the way for more accurate and efficient analysis, resulting in sharper insights and informed decision-making.</small>

## Results: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

<small>For Principal Component Analysis (PCA), three primary steps were undertaken. Initially, the data was examined in PC coordinates, followed by an analysis of the rotation matrix. Finally, emphasis was placed on understanding the variance explained by each Principal Component </small>

## Discussion

<small>The PCA analysis is used to look for groupings and patterns of the data based on all the appropriate variables
PCA analysis did not work particularly well for this data, since  just over 25% of the total variance is captured by the first principal component (PC1) , which is pretty low. Some data sets inherently require multiple principal components to represent different aspects of the variability, as is the case here.</small>
