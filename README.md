## Description:

This data set is from a 1980 experiment by Green and Byar from a randomised trial comparing treatment for patients with stage 3 or 4 prostate cancer

## Data:

Byar & Greene prostate cancer data, from Andrews DF and Herzberg AM (1985): [Data]{.underline}. New York: Springer-Verlag, and [lib.stat.cmu.edu](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/)). See Byar DP, Green SB (1980): *Bulletin Cancer*, Paris 67:477-488, Lunn M, McNeil D (1995) *Biometrics* 51:524-532, Schemper M, Heinze G (1997); *Statistics in Medicine* 16:73-80.

Once the supplementary data is downloaded in the form of a `.xlsx` file, it should be renamed to `raw_data.xlsx`and put in the folder `data/_raw` in order for getting running the script in the `R` folder ## NO NEED OF RENAMING; WE ALREADY HANDLE THIS ##

This dataset is the outcome of a randomised clinical study conducted by Green and Byar (1980, Bulletin Cancer, Paris, 67, 477â€“488) that compared the treatments given to patients with prostate cancer in stages 3 and 4. These authors used an exponential regression model with treatment by covariate interactions to evaluate the impact of treatment on survival. Conclusions on the relationship between treatment and various causes of death were reached based on clinical considerations. This study offers a more straightforward method for evaluating the impact of a treatment based on a model that acknowledges the problem's competing hazards.

The file from the original source was in a .xls format which was unable to be read by R. We could have converted it to .xlsx but we needed to install a package on the server, which is not allowed. For this reason, we have the data file in this repository, which is outside from the rforbiodatascience23.
