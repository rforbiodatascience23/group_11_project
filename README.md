## Description:

Prostate cancer

## Data:

Byar & Greene prostate cancer data, from Andrews DF and Herzberg AM (1985): [Data]{.underline}. New York: Springer-Verlag, and [lib.stat.cmu.edu](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/)). See Byar DP, Green SB (1980): *Bulletin Cancer*, Paris 67:477-488, Lunn M, McNeil D (1995) *Biometrics* 51:524-532, Schemper M, Heinze G (1997); *Statistics in Medicine* 16:73-80.

This data set is a result of Green and Byar's (1980, Bulletin Cancer, Paris, 67, 477-488) experiment anal from a randomised clinical trial comparing treatment for patients with prostate cancer in stages 3 and 4. These authors assessed the effects of treatment on survival using an exponential regression model with treatment by covariate interactions. Clinical considerations led to conclusions being drawn about the relationship between treatment and different causes of death. This paper presents a more direct approach for assessing treatment effect based on a model which recognizes the competing-risks nature of the problem.
