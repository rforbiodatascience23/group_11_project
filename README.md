## Description:

This data set is from a 1980 experiment by Green and Byar from a randomised trial comparing treatment for patients with stage 3 or 4 prostate cancer.

## Data retrieval:

Byar & Greene prostate cancer data, from Andrews DF and Herzberg AM (1985) (https://hbiostat.org/data/repo/prostate)

The file from the original source was in a .xls format which was unable to be read by R. We could have converted it to .xlsx but we needed to install a package on the server, which is not allowed. For this reason, we have the data file in this repository, which is outside from the rforbiodatascience23.
 This is the link to the original file: https://hbiostat.org/data/repo/prostate.xls
